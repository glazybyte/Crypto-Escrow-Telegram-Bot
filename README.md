# Crypto Escrow Telegram Bot
 This Python bot acts as a mediator between product sellers and buyers on Telegram. It securely holds cryptocurrency in a wallet (stored in a database) and releases payment to the seller upon mutual approval from both parties.

## Features

- **Escrow Service:** Users can use the `/escrow` command, and the bot will generate a wallet to receive funds for the transaction. The funds are held until both parties confirm they are satisfied with the exchange.

- **Shop Setup:** Sellers can set up shop items with either automatic or manual key/product delivery systems. Funds are automatically released to the seller upon successful delivery.

- **Wallet Security:** Crypto wallets are generated and stored in a MySQL database in an encrypted state. No external services are required to manage wallets.

- **Supported Networks:**
   - Solana
   - Litecoin
   - Dogecoin

- **Planned Networks:**

   - Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

- **Excluded Networks:**

   - Bitcoin (due to high fees and slow transaction times)

Iâ€™m open to discussions on which networks to add and how to make this bot better and easier to use.
