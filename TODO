#Feature
Add BSC support (30% done)
Unsure whether to add TON or not given high fees than rest upto now
Add ticket system for dispute purchases
Add Bot moderator support to handle tickets (Will need to hold a upfront fee for them if they scam, also will need to redesign transaction structure to include their share after assistance)


#Dev level
globalState.py, tx_interval_checker are little messy
Add universal command handler that distribute commands after basic processing
add use for enabled, hidden, OperaterCommand in command modules
